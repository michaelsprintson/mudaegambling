MIKES BOT USAGE GUIDE:

you are betting per roll that a character will be at or over 100ka. You get the prize ($checkprize) for every character at or over 100ka in the number of rolls you bet on. You pay the bet size per roll only on the characters that did not hit the 100ka mark. 

There are two types of bets: General and User-specific. General bets bet on the next 15 rolls from any user, whihc User-specific bets bet on a specific user's set of rolls. Since the bot tracks everyone's roll histories, you can bet on a particular person before or mid-way through each set of 15 rolls they do.

For example, if Armando is 7 rolls through a set of 15, you can bet on any of the remaining 7, and still be able to bet on as many of the next set of 15. However, you will bever be able to place 2 bets on Armando within one set of 15 rolls. However, if you do place a halfway through Armando's rolls, you can place another bet on Brittany's rolls immediately after your Armando bet concludes, with no requirement to wait a full 15 Armando rolls. Here is a diagram to explain:

Here, you can see that you are only prohibited from betting on the rest of Armando's rolls in his set of 15, even if you bet mid-way through his set of 15.

Here, you can see that you can start immediately betting on the next of Armando's set of 15 (in the case of resets). Keep in mind you cannot bet twice per a single set of 15 rolls.

Note that this does allow you to bet on someone else's rolls immediately, with no 15 roll cooldown like there are for general bets. 




to bet: $bet [number of rolls to bet on (2-20)] [total bet size (100-1600)] [offset (optional)] [@user (optional)]
    note: offset is the number of rolls to skip before betting starts. For example, $bet 5 400 10 means "wait 10 rolls, then bet 400 total on the next 5 rolls".
    note: Bets will be of type General unless a specific user is mentioned. If mentioned, the bet will be of type User-specific.
    note: If you recieve a pause emoji reaction, please wait the number of rolls mentioned to bet on that User-specific or a General bet again. If you recieve a pause emoji with no number attached, it means you are waitinig for a User-specific bet to expire.

to cancel a bet: $betcancel 
    note: can only be done if no rolls were done between you sending $bet and $betcancel

to check balance: $checkbalance

to check leaderboard: $leaderboard

to check the prize per win: $checkprob [roll type] [roll #] [total bet size] 
   note: not limited in the same way as bet so you can go wild with values 
   note: roll type must be accepted by mudae (hx, wa, mg, etc)

For returning users: Note that bet-per-roll has been changed to total bet! Previously, putting 400 in $bet meant 400 per roll, now it means 400 total across the number of rolls you put in.
